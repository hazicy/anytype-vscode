Two ways to group and organize your Objects.   
## Queries   
A live search of all Objects which share a common Type or Property.   
Lots of people compare Queries with databases, but there's a key difference: Queries don't *store* Objects like regular databases.   
Queries are a way to see a portion of your Graph, and Objects you've created, based on your filtered criteria, and several secondary filters which you can customize. You can think of them as a live filter or query for Objects which share certain criteria - specifically, a Type or a Property.   
Queries are your way to build **live databases** that update automatically as your objects change.   
### When to use Queries?   
We often get requests along the lines of: *How do I find all of the Notes or Tasks I've created?*   
One easy way is to create a Query based on Type.
For example: select *Object type: Task*, which will display every Task you've created in Anytype.   
![lists-query](http://127.0.0.1:47800/image/bafyreib7vckahegrrlpbijqedqbrsas72xbnlk6g2ur3lw6owppa5vycku)    
   
If you'd like to organize a task tracker, you can create views with Filters by Properties. For instance: first view with tasks filtered by *Due date: Today*, second by *Due date: Is on or after Tomorrow, *and the last one with *Done: Is checked.*   
You can then create a Widget which will appear in your Sidebar, acting like a folder for all Objects that meet certain criteria.

You can create a Query with the + button from your sidebar or using the / shortcut menu in the editor.   
You'll then need to choose if you want a Query by Type which lets you list all of your Objects of a certain Type, or a Query by Property which will list all Objects that contain the Property of your choosing.   
   
## Collections   
A folder-like structure where you can visualize and batch edit objects of any type. In can be used to:   
- Organize **different Types** of Objects in one place (e.g. *Recipes* + *Ingredients* + *Shopping list*);   
- Keep a hand-picked group of Objects together, **like a folder;**   
- Control over what’s inside — Collections don’t auto-update.   
   
Collections work more like a **traditional database**, where they start empty and you add Objects to them manually.   
### Creating Collections   
You can create a Collection with the + button from your sidebar or using the / shortcut menu in the editor.   
![lists-create-collection](http://127.0.0.1:47800/image/bafyreifqnuheqxplxuanvodnwipasjz673vrs6p33aij2p3iujcdxxu4ei)    
## Customizing Lists   
### Add Properties   
Instead of adding Properties one-by-one to Objects, you can batch-add them to your Query by clicking the filters on the right side.   
Here you can toggle on/off any Properties that you would like to see, add another Property or new Property, and edit the View of the Query here.   
![lists-addproperties](http://127.0.0.1:47800/image/bafyreieunai3dln23rcvt54klcrbfz2sx4xjyax333yqf3zbaqx3zeeslu)    
### Sorts & Filters   
You are also able to sort or filter your List by any Property that you've previously added to the List.   
### Layout   
In this section you can find all the currently available layout options.   
Kanban, calendar and graph views are available on desktop only.   
![lists-layout](http://127.0.0.1:47800/image/bafyreiedmfhourloxtgtwfz5tfaegy7wtsijfs62si4v2zgnpiklbiteu4)    
   
## Inline Lists   
`/inline` Query or Collection   
You can also add Query or Collection as a block to your objects and set views or filters that apply specifically in this place. Here’s the inline Query of **Pages** with Gallery view & sorted alphabetically.    
Check it out: click Pages title → open source Query → you’ll see the source has no filters or sorting applied.
