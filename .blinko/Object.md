Let's discover what Objects are, and how to use them to optimize your work.   
At Anytype we have created the concept that everything you create is an Object. Pages, Notes, Recipes, Books, Movies, Audio, Humans, *everything!*

## Ways to Create Objects   
### **Sidebar**   
When clicking the `Create` button, you’ll immediately create a new object with the type that is set as your default object type in your space settings.   
When clicking the arrow button, you'll be presented with a menu of your types. You can then choose which one you want to create.

### **Widgets**   
Click Plus icon inside a widget to create an object located in a specific place or having a specific type.

### **Shortcut **   
For a quick creation of a new Object, you can use this shortcut: `Cmd / Ctrl + N`   
This will perform the same action as clicking the "+" sign in the sidebar.   
Additionally, you can use `Cmd / Ctrl + Opt / Alt + N` to perform the same action as clicking the arrow sign in the sidebar.   
   
### Command Menu in Editor   
When working in the editor you can type `/` to bring up the command menu. If you already know which Type you want to use, you can just type it directly. If you're not sure which Type you want to use, you can type `Objects` instead for the below menu to appear with all of your Types listed. Simply select the Object Type you'd like to create and it will be linked at your current place.

### **Turn Text blocks into Objects**   
If you are working on something in an existing Object and would like to transform only a certain block into an Object, you can do that through the action menu.
